# ℹ Introduction



## Overview

Whether you want to play the game or become the game itself, 2xluckyFi has got you covered. 2xluckyFi is a prediction markets protocol where community-owned liquidity pools act as the house and ensure betting payouts, with a portion of house profits paid out to liquidity providers on a dynamic basis.

Users can bet with crypto through 2xlucky, our non-custodial Sportsbook and Casino, bets are sent to the 2xluckyFi house pools on the BSC Network. An oracle reports outcomes to the smart contract for settlement, removing all counterparty risk.

### Mission Statement

All betting platforms are engineered so the house wins, regardless of the successes of its patrons. It's a 5,000 year old business model, but until now — this model has been tightly controlled by the few who focus on maximizing profits, often at the expense of fairness and transparency.

In a world where distrust in centralized institutions is on the rise, it is 2xluckyFi's mission to place ownership and power in the hands of the users with a DeFi protocol that is driven by user-contributed liquidity, community-owned, and fuelled by the $2XL token.

## Future Products

In the future, 2xluckyFi aims to become host to many exciting DeFi-powered gambling and gaming products, both as a result of partnerships and collaborations with third-party businesses and developers, and of our own efforts in extending the 2xluckyFi ecosystem.
